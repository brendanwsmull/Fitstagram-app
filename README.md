# Welcome to Bitter

Yes I am aware that the name of the Repo is Fitstagram but I decided that I wanted a name change half way through development.

Bitter is a small and simple social media app built in React Native. If you're looking at after the time the App State fall 2024 semester grades are in, then that IP adress no longer works.

If you're running this for the first time make sure to:
  a) have React installed
  b) do ```npm install``` before starting while in the app directory
  c) start the app with ```npm start```
In case anyone was wondering I mainly designed this app with iOS in mind. I also used the Expo Go app to actually run and test it during development. 

Thanks for reading <3
